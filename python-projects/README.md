# Python Projects Repository  

## Overview  

This repository contains various **Python projects** that I have developed over time. Some of these projects were created for my **Computer Science I (CSCI 1470) class**, while others were personal projects aimed at improving my Python programming skills. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including **GUI applications (Tkinter), games, utilities, and SQL-based automation tools**.

## Repository Structure  

Currently, this repository includes the following Python programs:  

- **calproj.py** – A simple calculator project.  
- **facedetector.py** – A face detection program using OpenCV.  
- **hangmangame.py** – A text-based Hangman game.  
- **myclock.py** – A digital clock displaying **hours, minutes, and seconds**.  
- **numsorter.py** – A number sorting application.  
- **passwordchecker.py** – A password strength checker.  
- **passwordgenerator.py** – Generates a **random password** with a secure combination of characters.  
- **ponggame.py** – A simple **Pong game** built with Tkinter.
- **qr_maker.py** - A QR maker that creates and saves QR codes using an entered url. 
- **rockpaperscissors.py** – A **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where users play against the computer.  
- **sqlandexcelreportgenerator.py** – A script that automates **SQL queries and Excel report generation**.  
- **tictactoe.py** – A **two-player Tic Tac Toe game**.  
- **timegenerator.py** – A time-based utility application.

- **Pong Game (`ponggame.py`)** – A Tkinter-based Pong game for two players.  
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors (`rockpaperscissors.py`)** – A simple game where users play against the computer.  
- **Tic Tac Toe (`tictactoe.py`)** – A two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game with a Tkinter interface.  

### **2. Python Utilities**  
- **Password Checker (`passwordchecker.py`)** – Checks password strength and security.  
- **Password Generator (`passwordgenerator.py`)** – Generates **random secure passwords**.  
- **Number Sorter (`numsorter.py`)** – Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.
- **QR Maker (`qr_maker.py`)** – Generates QR codes based on entered urls.  
- **Time Generator (`timegenerator.py`)** – A tool that generates formatted time values.

### **3. Data & Automation Projects**  
- **Face Detector (`facedetector.py`)** – Uses **OpenCV** to detect faces in images.
